# IBM_MQ_PageSets_Monitor

a simple monitor for IBM MQ. builds a dynamically updated graph for the pagesets fill level.

this is the simplest application for the working needs of our development site.

think of it as an application to the repository: https://github.com/CrazyDoc/NJElib/tree/py3

Added an entry to the file (HA HA, fix it if you are going to use it) for sharing with Django. Django server with a schedule in real-time(used JS and Ajax) mode, see the neighboring repository

in the future, it will be upgraded to the client-server architecture level(nje server on the monitoring host and client on the lpar), an application collecting values in a more typical way on the lpar side.

if you have questions, suggestions for follow-up function - you can write to the mail
